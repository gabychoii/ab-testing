                    Run a simple A/B test on two different UI designs for an Appointment Booking website, and analyze the results.
                    The goal is to prove that specific changes in design (explained below) can result in improved user performance
                    and task execution. The A/B test serves to statistically determine whether a design choice could have impacted
                    user interaction.

                The outputs of the data analysis performed on these datasets (pictured above) represnets the shape and patterm
                of the data. We can visualize the direction and magnitude of change graphically. In this case, the mean is the 
                most important indicator of change between Version A and B, as it is an indicative measure of average performance
                when completing the task at hand - given the context of our measurements, our goal is to make a design change(s)
                that will reduce the difficulty/time of this task. Therefore, mean is a crucial measurement.

            <div id="section-description">
                Count, which represents the size of the data set, is also important, as the larger the count, the more reliable the
                data becomes, as it represents a larger group of people. In this case, our count is 39, which is a relatively small
                data set - this tells us our data could be slightly biased.
            </div>
            <div id="section-description">
                Lastly, median is the data point that lies in the middle of the sorted set. This value is less important than mean
                because it can be influenced by outliers, but is generally representative of the average.

            <div id="section-description">
                An example of analysis invoving this numbers can be seen with the misclick rate output and graph - we see that the
                misclick rate was the factor most significantly affected by the change in design from Version A to Version B. Thus,
                this tells us that our design changes may have assisted with button/information clarity.

                            The difference between the total distance in mouse movement on Version A and B is 
                            statistically significant, and therefore we reject the null hypothesis. The mouse movement
                            total in Version A is higher than the mouse movement total in Version B. We can logically
                            assume that the increased contrast and logical-reordering of Version B made the site functions
                            clearer and the overall task more straightforward (resulting in reduced scrolling and mouse movement)

                            Overall, 2/3 metrics indicated statistically significant improvememnts in task efficiency after changes
                            were made from Version A to Version B. Thus, we can conclude that the design choices were effective, but
                            there is still room for improvement in design and further efficiency.

                            Overall, this was my first experience applying principles I've learned in science classes (e.g. Scientific Method)
                            to computer science, and more specifically UI/UX. It was interesting to think about design from a statistical and
                            scientific view, as it helped me gage what can be detrmined "good" and "bad" design beyond the aesthetics I'm typically
                            influenced by.
